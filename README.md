# RandomForest classifier 

##Implemented from scratch in Python3, including own Tree class. 

Tested by cross validation and comparison with sklearn RandomForestClassifier method.
Tested on 7 different datasets.

Comparison results (Charts folder) show that classification accuracy of our own RandomForest is the same as in sklearn library,
however execution time (complexity) is quite higher.
